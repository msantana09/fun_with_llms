       "2  In the thick of things..... Hip, modern, bright and comfortable 4th floor apartment in the Capitol Hill district. My favorite restaurant is steps from the front door as are coffee shops, bars, cafes, grocery stores, and some of the most interesting people in town.  The apartment is a two bedroom, two bathroom modern, well built home. There are floor to ceiling windows in the main living/dining and kitchen room. Think treehouse on one side and on the other, think urban rooftop views. Cool if you ask me.  The master bedroom has a queen sized (latex mattress) and an en suite bathroom. The second bedroom is a kid's room (for kids of all ages) with one twin bed and a bathroom adjacent to it.  This comfortable and clean home is a fantastic gateway to a very urban experience outside the front doors.  On a serious note, in the Summer the neighborhood is noisy with urban life all around. There are restaurants in the courtyard, sirens, and street noise. If you want a quiet, out of the way experience, this is probably not t  "
